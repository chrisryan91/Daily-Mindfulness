Features:

    Navigation:
        - Logo to the right linked to the top of the page
        - Menu with links to home and each of the four pages: home, benefits, types and sign-up.
    
    Header:
        - The header contains the logo and name of the page style simply linked to the homepage. The black front on white background for me suggested a simplicity that reflected the practise of mindfulness. 
        - The navigation links to the side links to the rest of the page for quick access. 
        - This section serves as a basic introduction to the website. 

    Section 1: 
        - The image chosen to fill the screen in the first page is an image of a cloud: a familiar sight but with mindful practise hopefully our attention can be brought more clearly to this natural phenomenon. 
        - The text in contained inside the box in the middle of the image provides a basic definition of mindfulness and an basic description of the websites function.
        - The box has a colour of opaque light blue which appears darker due to the background image. 

    Section 2: 
        - The second section does not fill the whole page on desktop. It is a series of four divs styled inline that are each of 25% width. 
        - Each box contains a header with a benefit to be had from practising mindfulness and mindful meditation and a short paragraph explaining a little bit further. 
        - At the end of each paragraph there is an external link which links to further reading on the benefit to be experienced from mindful practise. 
    
    Section 3: 
        - The third section is divided veritically with two divs. 
        - The first div contains a heading and an ordered list giving step by step instructions to practise a basic mindful meditation. 
        - A paragraph underneath clarifies that mindfulness is personal and can look very different for different people so that while the step by step instructions are a way to practise mindfulness, it is just an example. 
        - The second div contains an image of a Tibetan Singing bowl in a circular div with a circular border. 

    Section 4: 
        - The forth section contains a heading followed by eight divs arranged into two rows of four columns each. 
        - The background of the eight divs is of another seperate image of clouds which is lighter in color than the first cloud image.
        - Each of the eight divs contain a heading and a paragraph element. 
        - The heading element introduces a specific type of mindful meditation. Each of these types of mindfulness vary by nature. Some involve stillness, some involve movement. 
        - The paragraph element gives a brief description of the heading which is above it. 
        - Closing the paragraph element is an external link  to a video giving examples or further instructions.

    Section 5: 
        - The fifth and final section is a sign-up page. 
        - The section is again two divs divided horizontally.
        - The right div contains an image of a hand with light reflected onto the skin - the hand and light again a familiar sight but hopefully mindfulness can help us see it in a new way.
        - The left div contains a sign-up form with three input elements. The first two are required name ad  email text input boxes with placeholders. The third is a submit button with the word Subscribe as its value.
    
    Footer: 
        - The footer contains four icons with no text and each one of them links to a social media website: twitter, faceboook, instagram and youtube.
