Features
========

Header & Navigation
-------------------

- Logo to the right linked to the top of the page
- Menu with links to home and each of the four pages: home, benefits, types and sign-up.
- The header contains the logo and name of the page style simply linked to the homepage. The black front on white background for me suggests a simplicity that reflects the practise of mindfulness. 
- The navigation links to the side links to the rest of the page for quick access. 
- This section serves as a basic introduction to the website.

Section 1
---------

  - The image chosen to fill the screen in the first page is an image of a cloud: a familiar sight but with mindful practise hopefully our attention can be brought more clearly to this natural phenomenon. 
  - The text in contained inside the box in the middle of the image provides a basic definition of mindfulness and an basic description of the websites function.
  - The box has a colour of opaque light blue which appears darker due to the background image.

Section 2
---------

- The second section does not fill the whole page on desktop. It is a series of four divs styled inline that are each of 25% width. 
- Each box contains a header with a benefit to be had from practising mindfulness and mindful meditation and a short paragraph explaining a little bit further. 
- At the end of each paragraph there is an external link which links to further reading on the benefit to be experienced from mindful practise.

Section 3
---------

- The third section is divided veritically with two divs. 
- The first div contains a heading and an ordered list giving step by step instructions to practise a basic mindful meditation. 
- A paragraph underneath clarifies that mindfulness is personal and can look very different for different people so that while the step by step instructions are a way to practise mindfulness, it is just an example. 
- The second div contains an image of a Tibetan Singing bowl in a circular div with a circular border.

Section 4: 
---------

- The forth section contains a heading followed by eight divs arranged into two rows of four columns each. 
- The background of the eight divs is of another seperate image of clouds which is lighter in color than the first cloud image.
- Each of the eight divs contain a heading and a paragraph element. 
- The heading element introduces a specific type of mindful meditation. Each of these types of mindfulness vary by nature. Some involve stillness, some involve movement. 
- The paragraph element gives a brief description of the heading which is above it. 
- Closing the paragraph element is an external link  to a video giving examples or further instructions.

Section 5
---------

- The fifth and final section is a sign-up page. 
- The section is again two divs divided horizontally.
- The right div contains an image of a hand with light reflected onto the skin - the hand and light again a familiar sight but hopefully mindfulness can help us see it in a new way.
- The left div contains a sign-up form with three input elements. The first two are required name ad  email text input boxes with placeholders. The third is a submit button with the word Subscribe as its value.

Unfixed Bugs
============

- For the #right-element div in the #method section of the project, I struggled to center align the #circlecontainer div within it when making the page responsive to smaller screen sizes. I fixed the problem by floating it to the left and decreasing the width and height of the #circlecontainer div as the screen responds to smaller sizes. 

- Similarly, the #left-element div in the #method section of the project, I again struggled with the same problem: center aligning a div within a div within a div. The second #circlecontainer div would not center align so I floated it left, decreasing its width and height in response to smaller screen size. 

- Due to this, the responsiveness of the site begins to break down below 300px.
